   In the command prompt, go to the folder where the files are located.
Then, type in: "perl Server.pl" (to run the server), and "perl Client.pl" (to run the client).

You can run multiple clients, which is advised to see the full use of this program.
Let's say you want to send a message from the 2nd client you connected to the first,
just type in on the second client: "1: Message here". This will send the message to the
first client. On the server, you will be able to see all of the messages sent private
and non-private. Also, you will be able to see which client sent the message. If you want
to disconnect a client.. Simply type in from client 1 or any other client: "1d" to disconnect 
client 1.

You can change the IP address within the code, line 14 in Server.pl and Client.pl.
